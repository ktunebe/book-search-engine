# book-search-engine

## Description

This is a project for UW Bootcamp in which we were asked to take a functioning book search engine built with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.  This app is built with a MERN stack, with a React front end, MondoDB and Node.js/Express.js.

## Installation

No installation needed.

## Usage

This app is set up for the user to be able to sign up/log in, search books, and keep a list of their books saved to the back end.
